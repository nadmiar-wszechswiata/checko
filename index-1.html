<h2>Baking the Perfect Wintertime Banana Bread</h2>
<span class="post-span">28th April 2012</span>
<p class="post-p-short">I always find this time of year a bit of a challenge. Up until January I am alright. Once summer is over, I manage to get through the cold.</p>

<p class="post-p-long">I always find this time of year a bit of a challenge. Up until January I am alright. Once summer is over, I manage to get through the cold months until then by looking forward to the holidays. I am the most eager Christmas Bunny, so I have no problem with letting myself start to plan things from September on. Once kids have gone back to school in the autumn it is fair game.</p>

<h2>James Averdieck</h2>
<span class="post-span">14th April 2012</span>
<p class="post-p-short">He was utterly charming. Relaxed and handsome in jeans and a crisp blue shirt, he was far too fit looking to suggest any over indulgence in his own favourite.</p>
<img src="" alt="post-img" class="post-img"/>
<p class="post-p-long">It is not often you get an audience with a founder of one of the most succesful food business of recent years. So it was with not a little trepidation that I made my way to meet James Averdieck, creator of the pudding giant that is GU. From where I was standing we ony had chocolate in common. What would he be like? A captain of industry checking his watch while I stammered out my questions?</p>

<h2>70% Tropical</h2>
<span class="post-span">7th April 2012</span>
<p class="post-p-short">My fellow chocaholics were mostly keen amateurs, all intent on getting closer to their favourite legal high.</p>
<img src="" alt="post-img" class="post-img"/>
<p class="post-p-long">The evening of 21st February found me making my way down Marylebone High Street. The plethora of gorgeus botiques did not distract me from my purpose. I even made it past the considerable pull of la Fromagerie undeterred. It is lucky that my route didn't pass Rococo, as that might have been impossible to resist. Chocolate was on my mind, but I had a date, a date with a whole assortment of fabulous chocolate. </p>
